##**üëã About me**

Hi, I‚Äôm @TrevorByron. I‚Äôm a big fan of async work practices and remote culture (my family lives all over the world and I do a lot of traveling to stay connected with them. Async+Remote has been very beneficial in staying connected with the people that mean the most to me). 

I hope this document helps you know me a bit better and most importantly, how I work.

I am a designer, tinkerer, and builder. I was born in Nairobi, Kenya, and grew up in a remote Maasai village in the southern highlands called the Loita Hills.  I then lived in Lisbon, Portugal for six years before moving to the USA in 2007. 

My path to design has been very much not straightforward. I've toured the USA multiple times playing music as a (https://open.spotify.com/artist/22FsgmdsdCGmi3SPwOVgBw?si=vBEnnSBcSsiX-M7GZJ4e9g&dl_branch=1 "singer-songwriter") , worked as a high-end Finish Carpenter, lead safaris in Tanzania, cleaned swimming pools in Dripping Springs, Texas, and worked a whole lot of other random jobs. 
I currently work as a Senior UX Designer at Toro TMS. 
Outside of work, I love riding mountain bikes and making things with my hands. 
I travel to Tanzania once a year to spend time with family. 

##**üë®‚ÄçüíªHow I work**
* Current Timezone - California Time ‚Ä®
* Work Hours - 8:30am - 4:30pm‚Ä®
* Make Designs, not Meetings - As a designer, my primary work is to discover and create. I try block out my entire afternoons (1pm - 5pm) to design and not meet. I turn off my notifications so that I can better get into the flow. Please expect my responses on slack or email to be asynchronous during these hours.‚Ä®
* Family - I have a 1 year  son, Robin, and my wife works full time on her own business. I take Robin every day from 12pm-1pm. Feel free to schedule meetings during this time, just know I‚Äôll have a baby with me 
* Collaboration - As much as I love working asynchronously,  I love collaborating. If we are both online, I‚Äôm very happy to jump on a call with you and work a problem out in the moment. 
* Prototyping - As much as I can, I design in HTML and CSS. I‚Äôm a fan of Figma and other design tools but I feel like I can better communicate a design vision with clickable prototypes. 

##**üì´ How to reach me**

* Slack - Direct messages or mentions work great during the day. I keep Slack openall day but turn off notifications during my focus design hours (1pm - 5pm), so it may take some time before I respond. ‚Ä®
* Meetings - I‚Äôm happy to meet on zoom as much as necessary, but I‚Äôll prioritize productivity over habit and will decline meetings without an agenda or clear goals.
